# M1 GPUs for (scientific) computations in C++

In this repo, I explore the capabilities of the Metal Shading Language 
combined with C++, specifically for use of accelerating scientific codes.
I wrote a few blog posts about the work in this repo:

- [Getting started](https://larsgeb.github.io/2022/04/20/m1-gpu.html)
- [SAXPY and FD](https://larsgeb.github.io/2022/04/22/m1-gpu.html)

However, if you just want to try out the code, make sure you install `llvm` 
and `libomp` using brew and Xcode and its command line tools. By cloning the 
repo and opening it in VSCode you should have all build configurations.
